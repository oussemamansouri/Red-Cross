# Red-Cross
 I developed a Red Cross-affiliated university club website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. 
 The website's primary goal was to facilitate student integration into social and voluntary work. 
 Through the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP, I created an interactive and visually appealing platform. 
 The website aimed to engage students, provide information about the club's activities, and encourage participation in social and voluntary initiatives.
